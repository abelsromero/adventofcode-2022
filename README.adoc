= Advent of Code 2022

Personal repo for https://adventofcode.com/2022/.

Main goal is practicing new languages, just getting things to work.

== Lessons learnt

* Day 1
** IntelliJ plugin can support multiple Rust projects under a root directory.
Just "attach" them selecting the `Cargo.toml` file.** `unwrap` causes move. Can't unwrap the same reference twice.
* Day 2
** Use `regex` to validate input valid lines.
* Day 3
** Writing unit tests for TDD approach.
IntelliJ can run & debug tests normally same as Java.
** Abstracting char as a struct required (done for exercising, in this case it adds code and complexity. Hoping the 0-cost-abstraction promise is true):
*** Derive Debug for printing the Vector containing it
*** Implement PartialEq trait to use `Vec::contains`
* Day 4
** A method can return multiple values, and that tuple CAN'T be passed to a method directly.
